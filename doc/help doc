The MovieDrive web page will store movies by year/genre/title and allow users to sign in and to access 
these movies and leave ratings and reviews on the different movies.  
Each movie will have a picture, description, and rating.  
The users will also be able to submit a request to add a movie to the repository.  
This website will be pink and feature hearts and puppies.
